CAFE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

What This Project Does:

This program serves as a basic billing system for Cafe Hideout. It allows you to:

⦁	Load the cafe menu (items and prices) from a text file.
⦁	Display the menu to the user.
⦁	Take a customer's order (item name and quantity).
⦁	Generate a final bill summarizing the order and total amount.

How the System Works:

The program is structured using three main functions and uses two primary data structures:

(Dictionary): Stores the cafe menu, mapping the item name (as a string) to its price (as a float). This is similar to the Equipment list in the provided example, as it represents available stock/items.

(Dictionary): Tracks the current customer order. It maps the ordered item name to a nested dictionary containing the ordered quantity and the item's Sub-Total. This is similar to the borrowed items list in the provided example, as it tracks items that have been taken /ordered by a user.

Technologies Used:
Python 3
Dictionaries and Functions
Loops and Conditions
File Handling

Why This Project Is Useful:

Beginners learning to manage data and build simple, function-based programs in Python.
Demonstrating how real systems handle basic inventory/pricing-based tasks.
Students making Python mini-projects, similar to the library management structure
